# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## Adding a changeset

When you make a change that should be released, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to:
1. Select which packages have changed
2. Select the type of version bump (major, minor, patch)
3. Write a summary of the changes

## Releasing

To release new versions:

```bash
pnpm changeset version  # Updates versions and changelogs
pnpm install            # Update lockfile
pnpm run build          # Build all packages
pnpm changeset publish  # Publish to npm
```
